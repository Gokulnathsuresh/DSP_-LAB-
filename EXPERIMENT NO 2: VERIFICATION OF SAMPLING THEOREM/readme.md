# **VERIFICATION OF SAMPLING THEOREM**

**Aim:**
To verify sampling theorem using sinusoidal signal in Matlab.

**Theory:**
The Sampling Theorem, also known as the Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem, states that a
continuous signal can be completely reconstructed from its samples if the sampling frequency
is greater than twice the highest frequency present in the signal. This critical frequency is
known as the Nyquist rate.
                                        fs ≥ 2⋅fmax

Where:
o fs is the sampling frequency (rate at which the signal is sampled),
o fmax is the highest frequency present in the signal.

**Applications:**
o Digital audio and video processing
o Communication systems
o Image processing
o Medical imaging
