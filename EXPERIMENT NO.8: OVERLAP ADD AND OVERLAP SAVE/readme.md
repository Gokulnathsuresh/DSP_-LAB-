# **OVERLAP ADD AND OVERLAP SAVE METHOD**

**Aim:**
To simulate linear convolution of two signals using overlap add and overlap save methods

**Theory**

*Overlap-Add Method*
This procedure cuts the signal up into equal length segments with no overlap. Then it zero-pads
the segments and takes the DFT of the segments. Part of the convolution result corresponds to
the circular convolution. The tails that do not correspond to the circular convolution are added
to the adjoining tail of the previous and subsequent sequence. This addition results in the
aliasing that occurs in circular convolution.

*Overlap-Save Method*
This procedure cuts the signal up into equal length segments with some overlap. Then it takes
the DFT of the segments and saves the parts of the convolution that correspond to the circular
convolution. Because there are overlapping sections, it is like the input is copied therefore there
is not lost information in throwing away parts of the linear convolution.
