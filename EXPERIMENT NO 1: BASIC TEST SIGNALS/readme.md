Theory:
1. Unit Impulse Signal:
o A signal that is zero everywhere except at one point, typically at t=0 where its value is
1.
o Mathematically δ(t) = {∞; 𝒕 = 𝟎
                         𝟎; 𝒕 ≠ 𝟎 }

2. Unit Step Signal:
o A signal that is zero for all negative time values and one for positive time values.
o Mathematically: u(t) = { 𝟏; 𝒕 ≥ 𝟎
                           𝟎; 𝒕 < 𝟎 }

3. Ramp Signal:
o A signal that increases linearly with time.
o Mathematically: r(t) = { 𝒕; 𝒕 ≥ 𝟎
                           𝟎; 𝒕 < 𝟎 }

4. Sine Signal:
o A continuous periodic signal. It oscillates smoothly between -1 and 1.
o Mathematically: y(t)=Asin(2πft)

5. Cosine Signal:
o A continuous periodic signal like the sine wave but phase-shifted by π\2.
o Mathematically: y(t)=Acos(2πft)

6. Square wave-bipolar:
o A pulse signal that alternates between positive and negative values, usually
rectangular in shape. It switches between two constant levels (e.g., -1 and 1)
for a defined duration.
o Mathematically p(t) = A for |t| ≤ τ/2, p(t) = 0 otherwise

7. Square wave-unipolar:
o A pulse signal that alternates between zero and a positive value. It remains at
zero for a specified duration and then jumps to a positive constant level (e.g., 0
and 1).
o Mathematically p(t) = A for |t| ≤ τ/2, p(t) = 0 otherwise (assuming A is
positive)

8. Exponential Signal:
o A signal that increases or decreases exponentially with time. The rate of
growth or decay is determined by the constant a.
o Mathematically: e^(at)

9. Unit Step Signal:
o A signal that is zero for all negative time values and one for positive time
values.
o Mathematically u(t) = { 𝟏; 𝒕 ≥ 𝟎
                          𝟎; 𝒕 < 𝟎 }
